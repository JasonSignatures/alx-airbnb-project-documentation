üè° ALX Airbnb Clone Project Documentation

Project Overview

This project involves building the backend infrastructure for a scalable, full-featured clone of the Airbnb platform. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience in designing, normalizing, and implementing complex database schemas, user authentication systems, and core business logic for a high-traffic web application.

üéØ Objectives

The core objectives of this backend project include:

Designing a Third Normal Form (3NF) database schema to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.

Implementing secure User Authentication and Authorization (Guests vs. Hosts).

Developing robust Property Management (CRUD operations for listings).

Creating a reliable Booking and Availability System to manage reservations without conflicts.

Integrating a mock Payment and Transaction module.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Backend Functionalities

The application's logic is organized into four major modules, each handling a critical aspect of the platform's operation:

Module

Core Responsibility

Examples of Functionality

User Management

Handling registration, login, session tokens, and profile updates.

Features and Functionalities Document

üõ† Technology Stack (Suggested)

While the implementation details may evolve, the system is designed to be compatible with a modern RESTful architecture, typically using:

Language: Python (e.g., Flask or Django)

Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (based on the current SQL schema)

Security: JWT for authentication
