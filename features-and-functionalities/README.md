üè° ALX Airbnb Clone Project Documentation

Project Overview

This project involves designing and documenting the backend architecture for a scalable, full-featured clone of the Airbnb platform. The focus is on establishing a robust, normalized database schema (3NF) and defining the comprehensive set of API functionalities required to support core operations like user management, property listing, and booking transactions.

üéØ Core Objectives

Database Design: Develop a normalized database schema (3NF) to ensure data integrity and efficiency.

Feature Documentation: Clearly define all required backend features, encompassing security, listing management, and financial transactions.

API Readiness: Prepare a blueprint for the RESTful API endpoints necessary for frontend consumption.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Backend Functionalities

The application's logic is structured around four critical modules:

Module

Primary Focus

User Management

Authentication (Sign Up/Log In), Authorization (Guest/Host roles), and Profile CRUD.

Property Management

Creating, reading, updating, deleting (CRUD) property listings; handling image uploads.

Booking & Availability

Checking property availability, creating/canceling bookings, and managing the review system.

Payments & Transactions

Processing payments, managing transaction history, and host payout tracking.

For a detailed, complete breakdown of every feature, functionality, and API requirement, please refer to the dedicated documentation file:

Features and Functionalities Document

üõ† Next Steps

The defined features and functionalities will serve as the foundation for subsequent development phases, including:

Detailed API endpoint specifications.

Implementation of the chosen technology stack (e.g., Python/Flask/Django, SQL database).

Unit and integration testing of the backend services.
